A sprouting integration of the [Firewheel](https://github.com/BillyDM/firewheel)
audio engine for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

**NOTE**: this crate is very much a work-in-progress.
The APIs are not set in stone, and not all platforms
are supported (notably `wasm`).

## Getting started

First, you'll need to add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy_seedling = "0.1"

# At this stage, it may be better to track the main branch
[dependencies]
bevy_seedling = { git = "https://github.com/corvusprudens/bevy_seedling" }
```

Then, you'll need to add the [`SeedlingPlugin`] to your app.

```no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_seedling::SeedlingPlugin;

fn main() {
    App::default()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, SeedlingPlugin::default()))
        .run();
}
```

[The repository's examples](https://github.com/CorvusPrudens/bevy_seedling/tree/master/examples)
should help you get up to speed on common usage patterns.

## Overview

`bevy_seedling` provides a thin ECS wrapper over `Firewheel`.

A `Firewheel` audio node is typically represented in the ECS as
an entity with a [`Node`] and a component that can generate
`Firewheel` events, such as [`VolumeNode`].

Interactions with the audio engine are buffered.
This includes inserting nodes into the audio graph,
removing nodes from the graph, making connections
between nodes, and sending node events. This provides
a few advantages:

1. Audio entities do not need to wait until
   they have Firewheel IDs before they can
   make connections or generate events.
2. Systems that spawn or interact with
   audio entities can be trivially parallelized.
3. Graph-mutating interactions are properly deferred
   while the audio graph isn't ready, for example
   if it's been temporarily deactiviated.

The main disadvantage is potentially increased latency,
since several milliseconds may pass between
event generation and actually propagating those events
to the audio engine. However, since
`bevy_seedling` provides direct access to the audio context,
you can always immediately queue and flush events
if necessary.

## Future work

- Graph operations

  Audio entities currently support only a subset of the underlying
  Firewheel graph API. In particular, disconnecting nodes and
  providing non-default channel configurations will
  need to be added.

- One-shot node pool

  One-shot audio nodes should be pooled, queuing up
  samples to play as sample entities are spawned.

- More audio nodes

  There are plenty of nodes that remain to be authored either
  in Firewheel or in this crate directly. Most pressing
  are probably looping sample players.

- Platform support

  Both Firewheel and this crate have some work to do in
  order to support `wasm` targets.
