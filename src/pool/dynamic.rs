//! Dynamic sampler pools.
//!
//! *Sampler pools* are `bevy_seedling`'s primary mechanism for playing
//! multiple sounds at once. [`SampleEffects`] can be used to create effectful pools on-the-fly.
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_seedling::prelude::*;
//! fn effects(mut commands: Commands, server: Res<AssetServer>) {
//!     commands.spawn((
//!         SamplePlayer::new(server.load("my_sample.wav")),
//!         sample_effects![
//!             SpatialBasicNode::default(),
//!             LowPassNode { frequency: 500.0 }
//!         ],
//!     ));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In the above example, we connect a spatial and low-pass node in series with the sample player.
//! Effects are arranged in the order they're spawned, so the output of the spatial node is
//! connected to the input of the low-pass node.
//!
//! Once per frame, `bevy_seedling` will scan for [`SamplePlayer`]s that request dynamic pools, assigning
//! the sample to an existing dynamic pool or creating a new one if none match. The number of
//! samplers in a dynamic pool is determined by the [`PoolSize`] component, which defaults to
//! [`DefaultPoolSize`].
//! The pool is spawned with the range's `start` value, and as demand increases, the pool
//! grows quadratically until the range's `end`.
//!
//! ## When to use dynamic pools
//!
//! Dynamic pools are a convenient abstraction, but they may not be appropriate for all use-cases.
//! They have three main drawbacks:
//!
//! 1. Dynamic pools cannot be routed anywhere.
//! 2. The number of pools corresponds to the total permutations of effects your project uses,
//!    which could grow fairly large. Silent sampler nodes shouldn't take much CPU time,
//!    but many unused nodes could grow your memory usage by a few megabytes.
//! 3. Dynamic pools are spawned on-the-fly, so you may see a small amount of additional
//!    playback latency as the pool propagates to the audio graph.
//!
//! Dynamic pool are best-suited for sounds that do not need complicated routing or
//! bus configurations and when the kinds of effects you apply are simple and regular.
//! Keep in mind that you can freely mix dynamic and static pools, so you're not restricted
//! to only one or the other!
//!
//! Note that when no effects are applied, your samples will be queued in the
//! [`DefaultPool`][crate::prelude::DefaultPool], not a dynamic pool.
